# Course Description

The course aims to introduce students to the foundational concepts of
data science and its impact on modern society. The course will develop
studentsâ€™ technical skills in data literacy, wrangling, analysis, and
visualization, while fostering an understanding of how data science
can be applied to real life issues.

# Course Objectives

Together, we will strive for your individual and collective success in achieving the learning outcomes of this course. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:

- Students will develop a foundational understanding of data science principles and their societal implications. 

- Gain proficiency in data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and basic programming. Cultivate data/computer/programming literacy to support further study in data science.

- Analyze real-world issues through data-driven approaches. 

- Prepare for advanced studies and careers by understanding the skills
and knowledge required in data science.
