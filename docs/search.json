Here you can find links to everything you’ll need this semester:\n\nThe course syllabus\nSubmit assignments at our course HuskyCT page (mortarboard icon in the upper right).\nI will post code, data, and lecture notes on the course GitHub repository (the octocat icon in the upper right).\n\n\nCourse Description\nThe course aims to introduce students to the foundational concepts of data science and its impact on modern society. The course will develop students’ technical skills in data literacy, wrangling, analysis, and visualization, while fostering an understanding of how data science can be applied to real life issues.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nTogether, we will strive for your individual and collective success in achieving the learning outcomes of this course. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nStudents will develop a foundational understanding of data science principles and their societal implications.\nGain proficiency in data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and basic programming. Cultivate data/computer/programming literacy to support further study in data science.\nAnalyze real-world issues through data-driven approaches.\nPrepare for advanced studies and careers by understanding the skills and knowledge required in data science.\n\n\n\nCourse Materials\nTo maximize access to this class, we will use some textbooks, videos, and other resources, with a focus on the following:\n\nPrimary Text (R4DS): Wickham, Hadley, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023.
